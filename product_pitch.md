## PRODUCT PITCH FOR NUCLEUS

> - Problem:

We see a large gap in elementary and middle school education accessibility for at-risk and underresourced youth. Particularly, more effective solutions are needed to allow underresourced schools without STEM funding to still have access and measurable metrics for student success and learning. 

> - Current Solution(s):

There are several e-learning programs that allow students from K-12 to learn a range of topics, but none that target elementary to middle school students in a fun way that allows teachers and students to both benefit from tracking their education. The closest solution is Khan Academy, which boasts brilliant content geared towards learning the sciences but does not have specialized education in chemistry, nor does it have a design oriented towards kids. 

> - Proposed Solution:

Introducing <i>Nucleus</i>, a hands-on element generator game on the web that allows classrooms of students to create accounts and manually react atoms together. Through our software, all students need is an Internet connection to learn about the basics of nuclear chemistry. 

> - Benefit(s):

v0 gives students in elementary and middle school a fun, systematic, gamified way to learn nuclear chemistry and help gain an understanding of how basic science works, both at the atomic level and in the real world.

v1 will allow teachers accessibility to student learning rates, as they will be able to see how quickly students are learning and earning points across the Nucleus system.
